# Bootstrap-Portfolio

I had a tough time with this one as well.

The Connect with Me box on all of the pages is a littl messed up, and I'm genuinely not sure how to fix it. Everytime I tried something, like trying to get it to float one way or push down below the main content, something weird would happen somewhere else, like it being vertically stretched.
